				<hr>
						
				<p>There are two types of QGIS installer packages;
				<p>1. QGIS standalone installer- this package installs the binary version of QGIS and the Geographic Resource Analysis Support System (GRASS) using a standard
				Windows installation tool. and</p>
				<p>2. OSGeo4W Network Installer - this package provides the user with opportunity to download either the binary or source code
				version of QGIS, as well as experimental releases of QGIS. Additionally, the OSGeo4W installer allows you to install
				other open source tools and their dependencies.</p>
				
				<p> If you want an easy installation experience of QGIS choose standalone installer and  and if you want an advanced
				features in QGIS choose OSGeo4W Network Installer option. For new users we recommend
				using QGIS standalone installers.</p>
				
				<div class="text-center">
			    <img src="{%static 'img/installation.jpg'%}" class="img-responsive" alt=""'>	
			    </div>
				
				Below are the instructions for downloading and installing each option. Remember, you only need one type of installation, so once
				you install Standalone installer you don't need to install OSGeo4W installer.
				
				
				 <p class="font-weight-bold">If you get stuck during installation watch the video below first before you seek for a live support.</p>
	
<br>
                                <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Standalone installer </h4>
				
				<hr>
                                 
				 
				 <h5>Installation Process</h5>
				 <p>Installing  Standalone QGIS installer is fairly simple. You can download
				 the installer directly from our gis4life server or from the qgis website. Keep the downloaded files in your local
				 directory for future installations. Make sure you download the same version of QGIS as the one used in this course (QGIS 3.2).</p>
				 
				 <p> To download Standalone Installer from GIS4life server click <a href= "{%static 'qgis.zip'%}" download>Download here</a>, then follow Instruction 1  below.
				 <P>Instruction 1.</P>

				 <hr>
				 <div class="flex f-start f-col"><small>Skip this part, if you installed Standalone installer.</small></div>
				
				 <p>Installing OSGeo4W installer is fairly simple. For this example, the OSGeo4W 64-bit installer is used. I like this installer because it can
				also be used to install other open source packages at one time. It's a bundled set of packages that you can choose what
				to install and/ or update. For new users the standalone installers are recommended. For more advanced users you can
				use the OSGeo4W package to install several versions in parallel. The installer is able to install from internet or just
				download all needed packages beforehand. The downloaded files are kept in a local directory for future installations.You can download the installer directly from our gis4life server or from the qgis website. Keep the downloaded files in your local
				 directory for future installations. </p>
				 
				 <p>1. Go to <a href= "{%static 'qgis.zip'%}" download> gis4life</a> to download from our server or  <a href="http://download.osgeo.org/qgis/win64/" target="_blank" />www.qgis.com</a> to
				 download directly from QGIS website. Make sure you download the right version of QGIS for your OS.
				 <p class="font-weight-bold">Watch the video below for more undestanding.</p>
				 
				 <p>2. After downloading the installer, double click on it to start installation.</p>
				 
				 <img src="{%static 'img/osgeo4w0.jpg'%}" class="image-responsive" alt="">
					<br><br><br>
					<p class="font-weight-bold">From three options above</p>
					<p>-First option: The express install-is a quick way of installing some of the most high profile OSGeo4W packages in a minimum
					number of steps</p>
					<p>-Second option: Express web-GIS install - is a quick way of installing GIS related drives.</p>
					<p>-Third option: Advance install- allows control over many details of the installations.</p>
				 
				 <p>3.Select first option click next.</p>
				 <img src="{%static 'img/osgeo4w1.jpg'%}" class="image-responsive" alt="">
					<br>
				<p> Go through the installation process using default options. Choose download source - use the Install from
			       Internet option. Use the default root installation directory as C:\OSGeo4W. Install for all users and select
			       options to create icons on desktop and start menu. During the installation process you may also get a
			       window that says other required software dependencies are needed - install them.</p>
				
				 <img src="{%static 'img/osgeo4w2.jpg'%}" class="image-responsive" alt="">
				
				<p class="font-weight-bold">End of Installation using option one. If you choosed option three, below are the steps</p>
				
				

				<p>3.For Optional Driver Installation, select third option then click next.</p>

				<br>
				<P>Working with GIS software requires lots of interactions with folders and files. If you are new in computer, file management is good for you.</P>
				
                                        
				
				<p>The data that we work with on our personal computer is all arranged in a hierarchical system which uses directories and organizes the files
				into a tree structure. Although we use the operating system for structuring our files, how we name them, how we organize the nested folders,
				and how the files in those folders are arranged, form the basic feature of file management.
				Keeping track of the files and being able to find them instantly at the time of requirement can add great value to understanding of GIS.

					<h4>What are files and folders</h4>
					<P><span>A file</span> is very much like a typed document that you might find on someone's desk or in a filing cabinet; it's an item that 
				contains a collection of related information. On a computer, examples of files include text documents, spreadsheets, digital 
				pictures, and even songs. Every picture you take with a digital camera, for example, is a separate file, and a music CD might 
				contain a dozen individual song files.
				Your computer represents files with icons. By looking at a file's icon, you can tell at a glance what kind of file it is. Here are 
				some common file icons</P>
					<img src="{%static 'img/fmngt11.jpg'%}" class="image-responsive" alt="">
						
				<p><span>A folder </span>is little more than a container in which you can store files. 
				If you put thousands of paper files on someone's desk, it would be virtually impossible to find any particular one when you needed it.
				That's why people often store paper files in 
				folders inside a filing cabinet. Arranging files into logical groups makes it easy to locate any particular file.
				Folders on your computer work exactly the same way. This is what a typical folder icon looks like: </p>
					<img src="{%static 'img/fmngt22.jpg'%}" class="image-responsive" alt="">	
					
					
				<h4>How Windows organizes your files and folders</h4>	
					
					<p>When it comes to getting organized, you don't need to start from scratch. Windows comes with a handful of common folders 
					that you can use as anchors to begin organizing your files. Here's a list of some of the most common folders you can store 
					your files and folders in:</p>
					
					
					<ul>
					<li><p><span>Documents. </span>Use this folder to store your word processing files,
					spreadsheets, presentations, and other business oriented files.</p></li>
					<li><p><span>Pictures. </span>Use this folder to store all of your digital pictures, whether you
					get them from your camera, scanner, or in email from other people.</p></li>
					<li><p><span>Music . </span>Use this folder to store all of your digital music, such as songs that
					you copy from an audio CD or download from the Internet.</p></li>
					<li><p><span>Videos. </span>Use this folder to store your videos, such as clips from your digital
					camera, camcorder, or video files that you download from the Internet</p></li>
					<li><p><span>Downloads. </span>Use this folder to store files and programs that you download from the web</p></li>
					
				      </ul>  
					
					<p>There are many ways to find these folders. The easiest method is to open the personal folder,
					which gathers all of your common folders in one place. The personal folder isn't actually called "personal"
					it's labeled with the user name that you used to log on to the computer. To open it, click the Start
					button, and then click your user name at the top of the Start menu's right pane.</p>
					<img src="{%static 'img/fmngt33.jpg'%}" class="image-responsive" alt="">
						<br><br>
					<p>Remember that you can create subfolders inside any of these folders to help you better
					organize your files. In the Pictures folder, for example, you might create subfolders to organize
					pictures by date, by event, by the names of people in the pictures, or by any other scheme that helps you work more efficiently.</p>
					
				<h4>creating folder</h4>
					Right click where you want to make the folder (on desktop, in another folder, etc.). 
					Choose New > New Folder. 
					
					<img src="{%static 'img/fmngt1.jpg'%}" class="image-responsive" alt="">
					<br>
					<p>Type a name, then press <span>Enter</span></p>
					
					<p>Right click and choose<span> Rename </span>to rename.  </p>
				<h4>Creating and deleting files	</h4>
				
					<p>The most common way to create new files is by using a program. For example, you can create a text 
					document in a word processing program or a movie file in a video editing program.</p>
					
					<p>Some programs create a file when you open them. When you open WordPad, for example, it starts with a blank page. This 
					represents an empty (and unsaved) file. Start typing, and when you are ready to save your work, click 
					<spanb>File </spanb>in the menu bar  and then click  <spanb>Save As</spanb>.In the dialog box that appears, type a file name that will help you find the file again in the future, 
					and then click <spanb>Save</spanb>.</p>
					
					<p>By default, most programs save files in common folders like Documents, Pictures, and Music, which makes it easy to find the 
					files again next time. </p>
					
					<p>When you no longer need a file, you can remove it from your computer's hard disk to save space and keep your computer from 
					getting cluttered with unwanted files. To delete a file, open the folder that contains the file and then select the file. Press DELETE and then, in the 
					<spanb>Delete File </spanb>dialog box, click <spanb>Yes</spanb>.</p>
					
					<p>When you delete a file, it's temporarily stored in the Recycle Bin. Think of the Recycle Bin as a safety folder that allows you 
					to recover files or folders that you deleted accidentally. Occasionally, you should empty the Recycle Bin to reclaim all of t
					he hard disk space being used by your unwanted files. </p>
									
									
				<h4>Viewing your files in a folder</h4>
					
					<p>When you open a folder and see your files, you might prefer larger (or smaller) icons, or an arrangement that lets you see 
					different kinds of information about each file. To make these kinds of changes, use the Views button in the toolbar.
					Each time you click the Views button, the folder window changes the way it displays your file and folder icons, alternating 
					between large icons, a smaller icon view called Tiles, and a view called Details that shows several columns of information 
					about the file. If you click the arrow next to the Views button, you have even more choices. Drag the slider up or down to fine
					tune the size of the file and folder icons. You can see the icons change size as you move the slider</p>
					<img src="{%static 'img/fmngt44.jpg'%}" class="image-responsive" alt="">
						
				<h4>Finding your files</h4>
					<p>When you need to find a particular file, you'll often know that it's located somewhere in a common folder like Documents or 
					Pictures. Unfortunately, actually locating the file you want might mean browsing through hundreds of files and subfolders
					not an easy task. To save yourself time and effort, use the Search box to find your file.</p>
					<img src="{%static 'img/fmngt55.jpg'%}" class="image-responsive" alt="">
					
					
					<p>The Search box is located at the top of every folder. To find a file, open the folder that contains the file you are looking 
					for, click the Search box, and start typing. The Search box filters the current view based on the text that you type. Files are 
					displayed as search results if your search term matches the file's name, 
					tags, or other file properties. Text documents are displayed if the search term occurs in any of the text inside the document.
					Your search looks in the current folder as well as all subfolders.</p>
					<p>If you have no idea where to look for a file, you can expand your search to include the entire computer, not just a single 
					folder.</p> 
										
					
					
					
					
					
				<h4>Copying and Moving files and folders</h4>
					
					<p>Copy vs. Move.</p>
					<p><span>Copy</span> -copy files and folders when you want to keep it in the original location, and add a copy in another location. </p>
					<p><span>Move </span>-move files when you want them in a new location, and you no longer need them in the old location.</p>    
							
							
					Copying Files
